# characters

Our data for November and December is a simple entry point to image analysis: automated recognition of historical, handwritten, Chinese characters, some of which may date back to over 3,000 years ago.

Some initial questions: 

* Is there a way to reliably identify what timeframe a character was written in?

* Are there relationships between words within different Chinese scripts?

* Are there patterns of similarity between images of the same word?

* Is it possible to automatically convert ancient handwriting to modern characters?
